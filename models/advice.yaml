      '<p>The Biopsychosocial Assessment (BPSA) is a vital component of a broader care planning and joint decision-making process for 
      individuals with self-harm. It provides a structured and comprehensive framework to understand the individuals needs by 
      integrating biological, psychological, and social perspectives. This multidimensional approach supports tailored interventions 
      and ensures that care is person-centred, context-sensitive, and evidence-informed.</p>'

    - title: Stanley-Brown Safety Planning Intervention
      content: 
        The Stanley-Brown Safety Planning Intervention (SPI) is a brief, collaborative, and 
        evidence-based clinical intervention designed to support individuals at risk of suicide. 
        It provides a personalized plan that enhances safety, builds coping capacity, and facilitates 
        engagement with follow-up care. It can be completed in approximately 20-45 minutes and 
        is suitable for use in emergency settings.

    - title: Understanding the suicide risk curve
      fold: True
      content:
        <p>When using the SPI, it is crucial to understand the <strong>suicide risk curve</strong>.</p>
        <p>Suicide risk is not static-individuals at risk often experience dynamic fluctuations in 
        their level of suicidality. Acute risk can escalate rapidly and may subside within hours or days.</p>
      
    - title: Why is this important
      fold: True
      content: 
        <ul>
          <li>Suicide risk tends to increase and then decrease over a relatively short time frame.</li>
          <li>The SPI is designed to help patients recognize their personal warning signs early, 
          before the peak of the crisis.</li>
          <li>By acting early in the curve, individuals are more likely to use coping strategies 
          or seek help before their risk becomes overwhelming.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The goal of the SPI is to increase awareness of these warning signs and empower patients to take 
        preventative action before they are in immediate danger of acting on suicidal thoughts.</p>
