        '<p>The Biopsychosocial Assessment (BPSA) is a vital component of a broader care planning and joint decision-making process for

        integrating biological, psychological, and social perspectives. This multidimensional approach supports tailored interventions

    - title: Stanley-Brown Safety Planning Intervention
      content: 
        The Stanley-Brown Safety Planning Intervention (SPI) is a brief, collaborative, and 
        evidence-based clinical intervention designed to support individuals at risk of suicide. 
        It provides a personalized plan that enhances safety, builds coping capacity, and facilitates 
        engagement with follow-up care. It can be completed in approximately 20-45 minutes and 
        is suitable for use in emergency settings.

    - title: Understanding the suicide risk curve
      fold: True
      content:
        <p>When using the SPI, it is crucial to understand the <strong>suicide risk curve</strong>.</p>
        <p>Suicide risk is not static-individuals at risk often experience dynamic fluctuations in 
        their level of suicidality. Acute risk can escalate rapidly and may subside within hours or days.</p>
        <br>
        <b>Why is this important?</b>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Suicide risk tends to increase and then decrease over a relatively short time frame.</li>
          <li>The SPI is designed to help patients recognize their personal warning signs early, 
          before the peak of the crisis.</li>
          <li>By acting early in the curve, individuals are more likely to use coping strategies 
          or seek help before their risk becomes overwhelming.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The goal of the SPI is to increase awareness of these warning signs and empower patients to take 
        preventative action before they are in immediate danger of acting on suicidal thoughts.</p>

        The treatment addresses the following five functions: (1) increasing behavioral capabilities, (2) improving motivation for skillful behavior, 
        (3) assuring generalization of gains to the natural environment, (4) structuring the treatment environment so that it reinforces functional rather 
        than dysfunctional behaviors, and (5) enhancing therapist capabilities and motivation to treat patients effectively.

        There are four modes of service delivery: (1) individual psychotherapy once per week, (2) group skills training once per week, 
        (3) telephone consultation as needed, and (4) weekly therapist consultation team meetings.

        In general, patients should be treated in the setting that is least restrictive yet most likely to prove safe and effective. Inpatient care may be necessary for patients who are assessed as being at high risk of danger to themselves or others, or if the patient is unable to cooperate with the psychiatric evaluation (e.g., due to intoxication, extreme agitation, psychosis or catatonia).
