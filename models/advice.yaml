    <h4>Structured Guide for Biopsychosocial Assessment</h4>
    <p>The Biopsychosocial Assessment (BPSA) is a vital component of a broader care planning and joint decision-making process for 
    individuals with self-harm. It provides a structured and comprehensive framework to understand the individuals needs by 
    integrating biological, psychological, and social perspectives. This multidimensional approach supports tailored interventions 
    and ensures that care is person-centred, context-sensitive, and evidence-informed. The below guide for BPSA is based on the 
    Irish BPSA, where it is a cornerstone of the national approach to managing self-harm presentations in emergency departments.</p>
    <p>The BPSA is a cornerstone of effective and person-centred care. When conducted with professionalism and sensitivity, it 
    provides valuable insights into an individuals life and circumstances. By integrating biological, psychological, and social 
    dimensions, practitioners can develop responsive and meaningful interventions that align with the individual needs and strengths.</p>

    <h4>Stanley-Brown Safety Planning Intervention</h4>
    <p>The Stanley-Brown Safety Planning Intervention (SPI) is a brief, collaborative, and 
    evidence-based clinical intervention designed to support individuals at risk of suicide. 
    It provides a personalized plan that enhances safety, builds coping capacity, and facilitates 
    engagement with follow-up care. It can be completed in approximately 20-45 minutes and 
    is suitable for use in emergency settings.</p>
    <br>
    <p>When using the SPI, it is crucial to understand the <strong>suicide risk curve</strong>.</p>
    <p>Suicide risk is not static-individuals at risk often experience dynamic fluctuations in 
    their level of suicidality. Acute risk can escalate rapidly and may subside within hours or days.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Why is this important?</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Suicide risk tends to increase and then decrease over a relatively short time frame.</li>
      <li>The SPI is designed to help patients recognize their personal warning signs early, 
      before the peak of the crisis.</li>
      <li>By acting early in the curve, individuals are more likely to use coping strategies 
      or seek help before their risk becomes overwhelming.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The goal of the SPI is to increase awareness of these warning signs and empower patients to take 
    preventative action before they are in immediate danger of acting on suicidal thoughts.</p>

  practical implementation: 
    '
    <h4>The Safety Plan includes the following six steps:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Warning Signs: </strong>Recognizing personal warning signs (thoughts, images, moods, 
      situations, behaviors) that signal a suicidal crisis may be developing.Example: "I start isolating myself"</li>
      <li><strong>Internal Coping Strategies: </strong>Identifying activities or strategies the person 
      can use on their own to distract from suicidal thoughts without needing to contact another 
      person.Example: listening to music, taking a walk</li>
      <li><strong>People and Social Settings That Provide Distraction: </strong>Listing places 
      or people (not necessarily for disclosure) that can help distract the person from suicidal 
      thoughts.Example: going to a café, visiting a friend</li>
      <li><strong>People to Ask for Help: </strong>Naming specific individuals the person can contact 
      during a crisis.Example: family members, friends</li>
      <li><strong>Professionals or Agencies to Contact for Help: </strong>Listing mental health 
      professionals and services that can be contacted in case of crisis, including emergency services 
      if necessary.Example: clinicians contact info, emergency hotline</li>
      <li><strong>Making the Environment Safe: </strong>Reducing access to lethal means and other items 
      that could be used for self-harm.Example: removing firearms, securing medications</li>
    </ul>
