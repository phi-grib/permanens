     '<h2>Assessment</h2>
     For all people who misuse alcohol, carry out a motivational intervention as part of the initial assessment. 
     The intervention should contain the key elements of motivational interviewing including:
        <ul>
         <li>helping people to recognise problems or potential problems related to their drinking.</li>
         <li>helping to resolve ambivalence and encourage positive change and belief in the ability to change.</li>
         <li>adopting a persuasive and supportive rather than an argumentative and confrontational position.</li>
        </ul>
     <h2>Pharmacological interventions</h2>Pharmacological interventions
     The choice of medication and doses depend on the current situation, for example assisted withdrawal, relapse prevention 
     or maintenance of abstinence.
        <ul>
         <li>The preferred medication for assisted withdrawal is a benzodiazepine (chlordiazepoxide or diazepam) 
         on a fixed-dose regimen starting at a standard dose and reducing the dose to zero over 7 to 10 days.</li>
         <li>After a successful withdrawal for people with moderate and severe alcohol dependence, consider offering 
         acamprosate or oral naltrexone in combination with an individual psychological intervention.</li>
        </ul>
     <h2>Psychological and psychosocial interventions</h2>
     Offer a psychological intervention (such as cognitive behavioural therapies, behavioural therapies or social network 
     and environment-based therapies) focused specifically on alcohol-related cognitions, behaviour, problems and social networks.'

     '<h2>Assessment</h2>
     When assessing suspected bipolar disorder:
        <ul>
         <li>undertake a full psychiatric assessment, documenting a detailed history of mood, episodes of overactivity and 
         disinhibition or other episodic and sustained changes in behaviour, symptoms between episodes, triggers to previous episodes 
         and patterns of relapse, and family history.</li>
         <li>assess the development and changing nature of the mood disorder and associated clinical problems throughout the person life 
         (for example, early childhood trauma, developmental disorder or cognitive dysfunction in later life).</li>
         <li>assess social and personal functioning and current psychosocial stressors.</li>
         <li>assess for potential mental and physical comorbidities.</li>
         <li>assess the person physical health and review medication and side effects, including weight gain.</li>
         <li>discuss treatment history and identify interventions that have been effective or ineffective in the past.</li>
         <li>encourage people to invite a family member or carer to give a corroborative history.</li>
         <li>discuss possible factors associated with changes in mood, including relationships, psychosocial factors and lifestyle changes.</li>
         <li>identify personal recovery goals.</li>

     <h2>Pharmacological interventions</h2>
     If a person develops moderate or severe bipolar depression and is not taking a drug to treat their bipolar disorder, 
     offer fluoxetine combined with olanzapine, or quetiapine on its own, depending on the person preference and previous response to treatment.
        <ul>
         <li>If the person prefers, consider either olanzapine (without fluoxetine) or lamotrigine on its own.</li>
         <li>If there is no response to fluoxetine combined with olanzapine, or quetiapine, consider lamotrigine on its own.</ul>
     
     <h2>Psychological and psychosocial interventions</h2>
     Offer adults with bipolar depression:
        <ul>
         <li>a psychological intervention that has been developed specifically for bipolar disorder and has a published evidence-based manual describing 
         how it should be delivered or a choice of psychological intervention (cognitive behavioural therapy, interpersonal therapy or behavioural couples therapy) 
         in line with the advice on treatment options for more severe depression.</li>
        </ul>
     Discuss with the person the possible benefits and risks of psychological interventions and their preference. 
     Monitor mood for signs of mania or hypomania or deterioration of the depressive symptoms.'

      When assessing a person with possible borderline personality disorder in community mental health services, fully assess:

      <li>psychosocial and occupational functioning, coping strategies, strengths and vulnerabilities</li>

      behaviour associated with the disorder (for example, repeated self-harm, marked emotional instability, risk-taking 
      behaviour and transient psychotic symptoms).
      Drug treatment may be considered in the overall treatment of comorbid conditions.

     '<h2>Assessment</h2>
      Conduct a comprehensive assessment that does not rely simply on a symptom count when assessing a person who may 
      have depression, but also considers severity of symptoms, previous history, duration and course of illness. Also, 
      consider both the degree of functional impairment and/or disability associated with the possible depression and 
      the length of the episode.
      Discuss with the person how the factors below may have affected the development, course and severity of their 
      depression in addition to assessing symptoms and associated functional impairment:
      <ul>
         <li>any history of depression and coexisting mental health or physical disorders</li>
         <li>any history of mood elevation (to determine if the depression may be part of bipolar disorder)</li>
         <li>any past experience of, and response to, previous treatments</li>
         <li>personal strengths and resources, including supportive relationships</li>
         <li>difficulties with previous and current interpersonal relationships</li>
         <li>current lifestyle (for example, diet, physical activity, sleep)</li>
         <li>any recent or past experience of stressful or traumatic life events, such as redundancy, divorce, 
         bereavement, trauma (also see the NICE guideline on post-traumatic stress disorder)</li>
         <li>living conditions, drug (prescribed or illicit) and alcohol use, debt, employment situation, loneliness and social isolation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Pharmacological interventions</h2>
      When offering a person medication for the treatment of depression, discuss and agree a management plan with the person. Include:
      <ul>
         <li>the reasons for offering medication</li>
         <li>the choices of medication (if a number of different antidepressants are suitable)</li>
         <li>the dose, and how the dose may need to be adjusted</li>
         <li>the benefits, covering what improvements the person would like to see in their life and how the 
         medication may help</li>
         <li>the harms, covering both the possible side effects and withdrawal effects, including any side effects they would 
         particularly like to avoid (for example, weight gain, sedation, effects on sexual function)</li>
         <li>any concerns they have about taking or stopping the medication (also see the recommendations on stopping
         medication).</li>
      </ul>
      Make sure they have written information to take away and to review that is appropriate for their needs.

      <h2>Psychological and psychosocial interventions</h2>
      Consider one of the following psychological treatment options if the patient experiences an episode of 
      moderate or severe depression:
