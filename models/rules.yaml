     Assessment
     For all people who misuse alcohol, carry out a motivational intervention as part of the initial assessment. The intervention should contain the key elements of motivational interviewing including
        helping people to recognise problems or potential problems related to their drinking
        helping to resolve ambivalence and encourage positive change and belief in the ability to change
        adopting a persuasive and supportive rather than an argumentative and confrontational position.
    
     Pharmacological interventions
     The choice of medication and doses depend on the current situation, for example assisted withdrawal, relapse prevention or maintenance of abstinence.
        The preferred medication for assisted withdrawal is a benzodiazepine (chlordiazepoxide or diazepam) on a fixed-dose regimen starting at a standard dose and reducing the dose to zero over 7 to 10 days.
        After a successful withdrawal for people with moderate and severe alcohol dependence, consider offering acamprosate or oral naltrexone in combination with an individual psychological intervention
     
     Psychological and psychosocial interventions
     Offer a psychological intervention (such as cognitive behavioural therapies, behavioural therapies or social network and environment-based therapies) focused specifically on alcohol-related cognitions, behaviour, problems and social networks.

     Assessment
     When assessing suspected bipolar disorder
         undertake a full psychiatric assessment, documenting a detailed history of mood, episodes of overactivity and disinhibition or other episodic and sustained changes in behaviour, symptoms between episodes, triggers to previous episodes and patterns of relapse, and family history
         assess the development and changing nature of the mood disorder and associated clinical problems throughout the person life (for example, early childhood trauma, developmental disorder or cognitive dysfunction in later life)
         assess social and personal functioning and current psychosocial stressors
         assess for potential mental and physical comorbidities
         assess the person’s physical health and review medication and side effects, including weight gain
         discuss treatment history and identify interventions that have been effective or ineffective in the past
         encourage people to invite a family member or carer to give a corroborative history
         discuss possible factors associated with changes in mood, including relationships, psychosocial factors and lifestyle changes
         identify personal recovery goals.

     Pharmacological interventions
     If a person develops moderate or severe bipolar depression and is not taking a drug to treat their bipolar disorder, offer fluoxetine combined with olanzapine, or quetiapine on its own, depending on the person’s preference and previous response to treatment.
         If the person prefers, consider either olanzapine (without fluoxetine) or lamotrigine on its own.
         If there is no response to fluoxetine combined with olanzapine, or quetiapine, consider lamotrigine on its own.
     
     Psychological and psychosocial interventions
     Offer adults with bipolar depression
         a psychological intervention that has been developed specifically for bipolar disorder and has a published evidence-based manual describing how it should be delivered or
         a choice of psychological intervention (cognitive behavioural therapy, interpersonal therapy or behavioural couples therapy) in line with the advice on treatment options for more severe depression.
     Discuss with the person the possible benefits and risks of psychological interventions and their preference. Monitor mood for signs of mania or hypomania or deterioration of the depressive symptoms.
